# New Note App
Just another web app that I made in order to practice what I learned

# Used technologies
- [Express Framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) as back-end
- [Json Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) with a json file as a database
- [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) with some CSS for front-end
- [EJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) as a view engine
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to make HTTP requests

## Run the app
- run `git clone https://github.com/islam36/new-notes-app.git` to clone the repo
- `cd new-notes-app`
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm start`
- open your browser and type `http://localhost:8000`
