# New Note App
Just another web app that I made in order to practice what I learned.

# Features
- Show notes when the page is loaded
- Add new note
- change the content of a note
- delete a note

# Used technologies
- [Express Framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and Node.js as backend
- [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) with some CSS for front-end
- Vanilla JavaScript to manipulate DOM and make HTTP requests (using the built-in fetch API)
- A JSON file to act as a database (simply because I think this simple app didn't worth that big database since there are just some simple data to deal with)


## Run the app
- run `git clone https://github.com/islam36/new-notes-app.git` to clone the repo
- `cd new-notes-app`
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm start`
- open your browser and type `http://localhost:8000`
