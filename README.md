# 📘Note-it
Just another web app that I made in order to practice what I learned. It's a simple web app that you can use to take notes.

# ✨Features
- Show notes when the page is loaded
- Search for a specific note according to its content
- Add new note
- Change the content of a note
- Delete a note

# ✨Upcomign features
- Change the background color of the note
- User authentication

# 🛠Used technologies
- [Express Framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and Node.js as backend
- [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) with some CSS for front-end
- Vanilla JavaScript to manipulate DOM and make HTTP requests (using the built-in fetch API)
- A JSON file to act as a database (simply because I think this simple app didn't worth that big database since there are just some simple data to deal with)




# 🏃‍♂️Running the app locally

- `cd new-notes-app`
